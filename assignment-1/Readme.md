### Description:
A small quiz website developed in base HTML/CSS. The questions are saved in a JSON file and are loaded dynamically. The user can choose between 2 different categories of questions and can see the results at the end of the quiz.
The code has been written in with a small state (global) and modified by few functions corresponding to the iterations of the questions.
The score takes in consideration the time spent to answer the questions and the number of correct answers.
The website is responsive and has been developed with Tailwind and DaisyUI.
