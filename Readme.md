### Description:
A small quiz website developed in base HTML/CSS. The questions are saved in a JSON file and are loaded dynamically. The user can choose between 2 different categories of questions and can see the results at the end of the quiz.
The code has been written in with a small state (global) and modified by few functions corresponding to the iterations of the questions.
The score takes in consideration the time spent to answer the questions and the number of correct answers.
The website is responsive and has been developed with Tailwind and DaisyUI.

### Description:
A small TODO list for movies / TV series developed in base HTML/CSS.
The core of the project is the implementation of a basic state management system in pure Javascript. See state.js for more details.
The state allows to subscribe to changes along the DOM and to update the state accordingly though actions.
The state has been made persistent through the use of the local storage. When the website is loaded with an empty local storage, the state is initialized with a default value (3 movies).
THe search doesnt modify the state, but it is used to filter the movies in the DOM, keeping it clean and simple.
